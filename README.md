This study investigates the impact of change over time on the performance of sentiment classification models using twitter datasets from 2013 to 2017. We evaluate five machine learning models - Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes – using two different feature representations: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag of Words (BoW). Models are trained on data from two different time periods, 2013 and 2016 and tested against more recent data, 2017, to access the ability of models to generalize to data from a newer year. Our results show that Logistic Regression exhibits the highest temporal robustness, while Gradient Boosting experiences the most severe degradation. Feature representation choice has minimal impact on model performance. These findings emphasize the importance of model retraining for long-term sentiment analysis applications and suggest that tree-based models perform best on more recent data, but linear models are more stable over time. Future work should explore deep learning approaches and adaptive feature engineering to mitigate temporal drift.
